# Feedfoward Neural Networks in C

## Objective
Make neural networks in C from scratch, in hopes of furthering the understanding of how libraries work on a lower level. Want to implement all the basics:

- [Neurons](#neuron)
- [Layers](#layers)
- [Activation Functions](#activation-functions)
- [Feedforward](#feedforward)
- [Loss Functions](#loss-functions)
- [Backpropagation](#backpropagation)
- [Gradient Descent](#gradient-descent)

## TODO
- objects []
    - layer[]
- activation function []
    - sigmoid []
    - tanh []
    - relu []
- feedfoward operation []
- loss operation []
- backpropagation []
- paralelize []

## Objects

### layer
The layer structure represents (wait for the surprise) layers in neural networks. It also holds neuron logit and activation states, basically all the information that isn't tweaked.

# Feedfoward Neural Networks in C

## Objective
Make neural networks in C from scratch, in hopes of furthering the understanding of how libraries work on a lower level. Want to implement all the basics:

- [Neurons](#neuron)
- [Layers](#layers)
- [Activation Functions](#activation-functions)
- [Feedforward](#feedforward)
- [Loss Functions](#loss-functions)
- [Backpropagation](#backpropagation)
- [Gradient Descent](#gradient-descent)
